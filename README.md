# Kmeans-clustering-scratch-vs-sklearn
Kmeans clustering both from scratch and using library on world happiness report.

I found that the result is almost equally the same on cluster 4, some of the clusters are exactly the same. I suspect the differences is due to the stopping condition. Mine is directly based on changes been made.

## Library used ##

* matplotlib
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
